# Image-to-Image Translation with pix2pix (cGAN)

This project demonstrates image-to-image translation using a conditional GAN (pix2pix).
A pre-trained pix2pix model is used to transform an input image into a target image.

# Features
- Uses pix2pix (conditional GAN)
- Pre-trained model for fast inference
- CPU-compatible implementation

# Tech Stack
- Python
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- PIL

# How to Run
pip install -r requirements.txt
python pix2pix_inference.py
